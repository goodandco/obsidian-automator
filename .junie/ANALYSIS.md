# AI Technical Analysis and Refactoring Recommendations
Date: 2025-09-29

This document summarizes the architecture, build configuration, and recommendations for the ProjectFlow Obsidian plugin, based on the current repository state.

## 1. Build and Configuration
- Toolchain
  - TypeScript 4.7.4; esbuild 0.17.x; Node 16+ compatible.
  - Entry: main.ts → bundles to CommonJS; target ES2018; externals: obsidian, electron, CodeMirror packages, Node builtins.
  - Output: main.js in repo root (required by Obsidian alongside manifest.json and styles.css).
- Commands
  - dev: npm run dev → node esbuild.config.mjs (watch via esbuild.context).
  - build: npm run build → tsc type-check (no emit) + node esbuild.config.mjs production (single rebuild; minified).
- Esbuild details
  - Injects banner at top of main.js: "THIS IS A GENERATED/BUNDLED FILE BY ESBUILD".
  - Sourcemaps inline in dev; disabled in production; tree-shaking enabled.
  - Externalized modules avoid bundling Obsidian/CM/etc.; required for Obsidian runtime.
- TypeScript
  - strict-ish: noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks, isolatedModules, moduleResolution node, target ES6, module ESNext.
  - inlineSourceMap/inlineSources enabled for dev.

Status: Build verified via temporary script; main.js generated with banner successfully.

## 2. Obsidian Plugin Layout
- Manifest
  - id: project-flow (must match folder name under <vault>/.obsidian/plugins/project-flow)
  - version: 1.0.1 (aligned with package.json)
- Files Obsidian loads: manifest.json, main.js, styles.css (all present in repo root).
- Template expectation during runtime: The plugin reads template sources at `.obsidian/plugins/<manifest.id>/src/templates/*.md` inside the vault.

## 3. Architecture Overview
- main.ts
  - Exports AutomatorPlugin from src/plugin.ts.
- src/plugin.ts
  - Registers command id: add-project-info.
  - Prompts user for project name, tag, optional parent, dimension, category.
  - Generates variables (YEAR, DATE, PROJECT_FULL_NAME, paths, etc.).
  - Creates folder structure: `1. Projects/<Dimension>/<Category>/<Year[.Parent].Name>/` with subfolders Knowledge Base, Meetings, Work, People.
  - Creates main notes from templates: project.md, meetings.md, people.md, work.md.
  - Creates project-specific Templates folder: `Templates/<Name>_Templates/` populated from multiple template-* sources.
  - Variable substitution: replaces tokens of form $_VARIABLE in templates.
- src/settings-tab.ts
  - Settings UI to manage Dimensions and Categories (add/rename/delete) with confirm-to-reset modal.
  - Persists settings via plugin data; uses Obsidian DOM helpers and icon utilities.
- src/input-modal.ts and src/choise-modal.ts
  - Minimal modals for text and choice prompts.
- src/interfaces.ts
  - Strong type definitions for settings, project info, and template variables.

## 4. Notable Observations and Risks
- Naming typos
  - File choise-modal.ts (typo in name); template target names include "Discusion" and "idea" casing. Functional but stylistically inconsistent; renaming would require migration care.
- File creation behavior
  - Uses this.app.vault.create which throws if file exists. Enhancement opportunity: check existence and choose skip/overwrite semantics.
- Hardcoded root path
  - "1. Projects" is hardcoded; could be made configurable in settings for broader compatibility.
- PARENT_TAG semantics
  - Currently equals PROJECT_TAG when parent exists (empty otherwise). Documented; acceptable for now but could be decoupled if different taxonomy is desired.
- Testing strategy
  - No unit tests configured; feasible next step is to extract pure helpers (generateProjectVariables, processTemplate) into a lib for unit testing without Obsidian runtime.

## 5. Recommendations
1. Extract pure helpers into src/lib (e.g., src/lib/project-vars.ts) to enable unit tests; keep plugin.ts consuming these.
2. Add minimal CI build verification: run npm ci && npm run build and assert banner presence and size in main.js.
3. Consider settings to configure the projects root directory name.
4. Improve create semantics: if file exists, either append, overwrite with confirmation, or skip and notify.
5. Optional cleanup: rename choise-modal.ts to choice-modal.ts and fix "Discusion"/"idea" casing across templates and code, with backward-compat notes.

## 6. Verified Build Step
- A temporary Node ESM script (scripts/build.test.mjs) was used to verify the production build and banner presence, then removed to keep repo clean. Build succeeded.

## 7. Conclusion
The ProjectFlow plugin build and architecture conform to the documented guidelines. The codebase is ready for continued development. The recommendations above are non-breaking enhancements to improve robustness, maintainability, and testability.
